I a statistician and origami modeler in Saint Paul, Minnesota, USA.  I'm most interested in how people recognize animals and other objects that are not highly realistic.  I tend to exaggerate distinctive features to aid recognition in models that only take a few minutes to fold.  

I started Open Origami to share my designs.
